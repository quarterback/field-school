  <p class="text-xl mb-6">A short-format, cohort-based field school for people who work across complex systems and want to grow their strategic fluency in real-world conditions.</p>

  <section class="mb-12">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-heading mb-4">Why Strategic Weather?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Because you work inside shifting conditions—political, technical, cultural—and you're expected to deliver clarity and results anyway. This program is about learning to read those conditions and act skillfully within them.</p>
    <p>This is not just for designers or strategists. It’s for people doing cross-functional work in policy, ops, infrastructure, delivery, or systems work of any kind.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-12">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-heading mb-4">What it is</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Strategic Weather Field School is a 1.5-day learning experience. You’ll bring what you know, and leave with tools and language to teach others. The program blends applied theory, strategic thinking, and systems awareness in a way that’s useful across roles and sectors.</p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>Evening 1: Arrival and cohort grounding</li>
      <li>Day 2: Full day of exercises, conversation, and reflection</li>
      <li>Day 3: Morning synthesis and dispatch</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-12">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-heading mb-4">Who it's for</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">You might be a service designer, policy lead, delivery manager, systems researcher, or just the person everyone turns to when things get unclear. What matters is that you work across systems—and want to get better at doing it with intention and language.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-heading mb-4">What you'll leave with</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
      <li>A shared vocabulary for strategic, systems-oriented work</li>
      <li>Tools and prompts to use in your own orgs</li>
      <li>A peer cohort that spans sectors and disciplines</li>
      <li>Clarity on how to teach and grow this work inside your context</li>
